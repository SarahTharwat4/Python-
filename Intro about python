 What is Python?
Python is a widely used high-level programming language created by Guido
van Rossum in the late 1980s.

The language places strong emphasis on code
readability and simplicity, making it possible for programmers to develop
applications rapidly.

Like all high level programming languages, Python code resembles the
English language which computers are unable to understand.

If you are new to programming, Python is a great place to start. One of the
key features of Python is its simplicity, making it the ideal language for
beginners to learn. Most programs in Python require considerably fewer
lines of code to perform the same task compared to other languages such as
C. This leads to fewer programming errors and reduces the development
time needed. In addition, Python comes with an extensive collection of third
party resources that extend the capabilities of the language. As such, Python
can be used for a large variety of tasks, such as for desktop applications,
database applications, network programming, game programming and even
mobile development. Last but not least, Python is a cross platform
language, which means that code written for one operating system, such as
Windows, will work well on Mac OS or Linux without making any changes
to the Python code.
